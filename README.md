# Sita-Sliver

This project is intended for experimental code.
Here primarily to experiment with APIs.
What follows is just a demonstration of the 'Markdown' language for documenting information through a Wiki page.

Example of code snippets display with language highlighting where applicable,

javascript
```javascript
function test01() {
  onsole.log("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy hound");
}
```
ksh
```ksh
{
  # what's being input to this program??
  #  print

  # initialize certain startup variables
  if( startup != 1 )
  {
     i = j = 0; 
     if( station ~ /vol/ )
       station_cmpd = sprintf("VOL%s_VSTA", substr(station,4,6))
     else station_cmpd = sprintf("%s_STA", station)
     ecb_cmpd = sprintf("%s_ECB", station);
     startup = 1;
}
```
